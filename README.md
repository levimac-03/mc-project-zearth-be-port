Welcome to the **<span style="color:blue;">Project Zearth</span>** port. This repository brings the expansive world of Project Zearth, originally created for Java Edition, to Bedrock Edition.

## How It Was Accomplished

This conversion was made possible using **Amulet V0.10.35** to ensure that the map functions smoothly in Bedrock Edition. The converted version is **Project Zearth v15**, the latest release available. For further information about the tool, check out [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

## Why Choose Amulet?

Amulet was selected over JE2BE for the following reasons:

- **Chunk-by-Chunk Precision:** Critical for accurately handling a large and intricate map like Project Zearth.
- **Entity Management:** Ensures the correct transfer of entities and tile entities during the conversion process.
- **NBT Data Integrity:** Preserves all essential map details, ensuring a faithful recreation in Bedrock.

While JE2BE is suitable for straightforward conversions, Amulet offers the precision and reliability needed for a detailed map like Project Zearth.
